        ## Implementation Hints
        
        **For the Copilot coding agent:**
        - Consider which files need to be modified:
          - Frontend UI changes: `src/static/index.html`, `src/static/app.js`, `src/static/styles.css`
          - Backend API changes: `src/backend/routers/activities.py`, `src/backend/routers/auth.py`
          - Database changes: `src/backend/database.py`
        - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
        - Ensure proper authentication/authorization for teacher-only features
        - Test the feature thoroughly across different user scenarios
        - Consider mobile responsiveness and accessibility
        - Add appropriate error handling and user feedback
        
        ## Context
        
        This is for the Mergington High School activity management system. New features should enhance the experience for teachers and students while maintaining the system's simplicity and reliability. The system is used daily for managing extracurricular activities.
