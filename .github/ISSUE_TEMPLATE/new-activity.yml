        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        When this request is completed, the following should be true:
        - [ ] New activity appears in the activities list on the website
        - [ ] Students can sign up for the activity
        - [ ] Activity shows correct schedule and description
        - [ ] Activity respects the maximum participant limit
        - [ ] Teacher can manage student enrollments for this activity
        
        ## Implementation Hints
        
        **For the Copilot coding agent:**
        - Add the new activity to the `initial_activities` dictionary in `src/backend/database.py`
        - Follow the existing format with `description`, `schedule`, `schedule_details`, `max_participants`, and `participants` fields
        - The `schedule_details` should include `days` array, `start_time`, and `end_time`
        - Initialize `participants` as an empty array `[]`
        - Test that the activity appears on the website and students can register
        
        ## Context
        
        This is for the Mergington High School activity management system. The system stores activities in a MongoDB database and displays them on a web interface where students can sign up.
