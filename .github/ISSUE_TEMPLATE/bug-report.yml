        ## Implementation Hints
        
        **For the Copilot coding agent:**
        - First reproduce the issue by following the steps provided
        - Check browser developer console for JavaScript errors
        - Review server logs for backend errors
        - Look for common issues in the affected code area:
          - Authentication problems in `src/backend/routers/auth.py`
          - Activity management issues in `src/backend/routers/activities.py`
          - Database connection/query issues in `src/backend/database.py`
          - Frontend JavaScript errors in `src/static/app.js`
        - Test the fix thoroughly before marking as complete
        - Consider edge cases and error handling
