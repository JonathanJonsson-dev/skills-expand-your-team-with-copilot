        ## Acceptance Criteria
        
        When this request is completed, the following should be true:
        - [ ] Student enrollment status is correctly updated in the system
        - [ ] Student can see their enrollment status on the website
        - [ ] Activity participant count is accurate
        - [ ] No enrollment conflicts or errors remain
        - [ ] Teacher can verify the change was successful
        
        ## Implementation Hints
        
        **For the Copilot coding agent:**
        - Student enrollments are stored in the `participants` array of each activity in the database
        - Use the activities API endpoints: `/activities/{activity_name}/signup` for adding students
        - Use the `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister` for removing students
        - Check current enrollment before adding to avoid duplicates
        - Respect the `max_participants` limit when adding students
        - Validate student email format (should end with @mergington.edu)
        - Update the database through the appropriate MongoDB operations
        - Test the changes by checking the website and API responses
        
        ## Context
        
        This is for the Mergington High School activity management system. Student enrollments are managed through a web interface and API. Teachers need to be able to help students who have trouble with online signup or need manual adjustments.
